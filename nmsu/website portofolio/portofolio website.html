            <h3>Cybersecurity Student / Programmer</h3>
            <p>
                Hello! I’m Aldo Mata, a Cybersecurity undergraduate at New Mexico State University with a strong passion for programming and secure computing. I have a interest in exploring various areas of cybersecurity, including penetration testing, network security, and encryption technologies. My goal is to develop innovative solutions that address real-world security challenges.
    
                Recently, I’ve been involved in several projects that have allowed me to apply my knowledge in practical settings, enhancing my skills in programming languages like Java, C++, and C. I'm excited to further my education and gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity tools and practices as I prepare for a career in this dynamic field.
    
                Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I would love to connect with you on LinkedIn to share insights and opportunities in the cybersecurity realm.
